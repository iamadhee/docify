## What is Docify?

Docify is a Python-based documentation tool that simplifies the documentation process for developers. It allows you to generate documentation for your codebase, including functions, classes, and modules. With Docify, you can easily create a comprehensive documentation website for your project. 

----

## Features

- Automatic generation of documentation for your codebase

----

## Getting Started

To start using Docify, simply clone the repository and follow the installation instructions. Once installed, you can generate documentation for your project using the `docify` command.

### Folder Structure of the Repository

The repository contains the following files:

- `LICENSE`: The MIT License for the project
- `documentor.py`: The main Python script for the project
- `config.yaml`: The configuration file for the project

### Content of the Repository

The `documentor.py` file contains the main logic for the project. It imports several Python modules, including `json`, `yaml`, and `pathlib`. It also imports the `GPTSimpleVectorIndex` and `GPTTreeIndex` classes from the `gpt_index` module, as well as the `ChatOpenAI` class from the `langchain.chat_models` module. 

The `config.yaml` file contains the configuration settings for the project, including the API key for the OpenAI GPT-3 API.

## How Docify Works

Docify uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate documentation for your codebase. It analyzes your code and generates a summary of each function, class, and module. It then uses natural language processing to generate a description of each item, including its purpose and usage.
