# Docify

Docify is a Python package for generating README.md files for your repositories. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate high-quality content in raw markdown format, which you can then customize to your liking.

## Features

- Generate high-quality README.md files in seconds
- Customize the generated content to suit your needs
- Easy to use and integrate with your existing workflow

## How Docify Works

Docify uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to generate content for your README.md files. It analyzes your repository's folder structure, configuration files, and code to understand what your project is about and what it can do. It then generates a template for your README.md file, which you can customize to your liking.

## Getting Started

To get started with Docify, simply install it using pip:

```bash
pip install docify
```

Once installed, you can use it to generate a README.md file for your repository:

```bash
docify generate
```

This will generate a README.md file in the root directory of your repository. You can then customize it to your liking.
