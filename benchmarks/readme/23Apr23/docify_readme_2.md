## How Docify Works

Docify uses GPT models to generate text based on a prompt. The text is then used to generate a README.md file using customizable templates. Docify also indexes your repository's files, making it easy for users to find what they're looking for. 

---

## Getting Started

To get started with Docify, simply install the required packages using pip: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, create a new configuration file called `config.yaml`. In this file, you can specify the model and prompt to use for generating text. 

Once you've created your configuration file, you can use Docify to generate a README.md file: 

```
python documentor.py
```

Docify will generate a README.md file based on your configuration and templates.
