## What is Docify? üìù

Docify is a Python package that helps you generate beautiful README.md files for your repositories. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate text based on prompts and templates, making it easy to create professional-looking documentation in minutes.

## Features üöÄ

- Easy to use: Docify is designed to be simple and intuitive, so you can start generating documentation right away.

## How Docify Works ü§ñ

Docify works by reading a configuration file that specifies the prompts and templates to use for generating documentation. It then uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate text based on the prompts, and inserts the text into the templates to create the final documentation.

To get started with Docify, simply install the package using pip:

```
pip install docify
```

Then, create a configuration file that specifies the prompts and templates to use for generating documentation. Finally, run Docify to generate your README.md file:
